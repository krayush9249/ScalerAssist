even remember how the past few

“I'd like to thank the Scaler
team-—great instructors like Mohit
Uniyal and Scaler's teaching
assistants made my transition into
the DSML field very smooth. While
Data Analytics wasn't my initial area
of interest, attending classes and
immersing myself in learning allowed
me to discover a genuine interest and

India's business landscape is experiencing a seismic shift. Technological
advancements & integrations, initiatives like 'Make in India' and increased
startup funding have transformed how Indians approach business.

Today technology is no longer an afterthought, it is a critical element for the

survival of a business.

However, traditional B-schools need to prepare graduates to meet the
challenges of the modern business world. There’s a substantial gap between
what conventional business programs teach and the skills needed to thrive in
this tech-powered business landscape. A 2020 India Skill Report shows that
only 46.59% of students have enough professional skills to get hired.

There is a need for a Business program that integrates management and
technology, narrows the skill gap, and aims to align educational outcomes with
the demands of today's workplace. After months of research and gauging the
current industry needs, we've designed a program that delivers just that.

Through Scaler School of Business, we are launching a one-of-a-kind PG Program
in Management & Technology, 18 months long, full-time, and on campus. The PG
Program in Mgmt and Tech places a premium on practical and experiential
learning, through company-sourced projects, immersive case studies, and
direct engagement with industry leaders. Our students will gain invaluable
experience that transcends the confines of the classroom, leaving no stone unturned
and no business fundamentals unlearned. Clubbed with our comprehensive, opt-in
residential services, this program is the lever that you need to pull to become a
sought-after leader!

At Scaler, we're not creating followers; we're nurturing leaders who will shape
the future of business.

Welcome to the era of innovation and new-age business education!

The Need for an
Industry-focused B-school
in Today's India

The world of business is revolutionising faster than before. The present times have
signalled a clear shift powered by tech advancements like Al, ML, Blockchain and
more. Hence, the future of work demands a tech-savvy workforce. A McKinsey
report estimates that 375M* global workers will need to adapt to Al and
automation by 2030. India will face an even steeper challenge based on how

organisations adapt and adopt the change.

Early business education began with foundational subjects like maths and
economics to equip students with core business understanding. Over time, with
the industry's growing needs, it expanded to functions like marketing, finance,
and operations. Today, however, the focus has shifted towards industry-specific

skills and integrating technology into business strategy.

2024 demands an educational approach that is practical-first, tech elevated
and goes beyond the traditional. Moreover, a survey by GMAC emphasises how
‘soft skills’ like the ability to adapt to technological shifts and strategic thinking will

be valued more over traditional business knowledge.

With 10M new jobs* projected by 2027 in India, we aim to equip future leaders
with the skills to thrive in this digital era. Our PG Program in Mgmt. & Tech focuses

on empowering students through practical skills & equipping them with tech.

Co-founders’ Note
The last two years have been challenging worldwide; and while the overall sentiment
might be cautious, we see technology influencing and entering sectors that
traditionally have kept away from it. With Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI
taking the centre stage, we will see a lot of unique opportunities for those well-versed
in the software-tech ecosystem. Our assessment report highlights this very fact.
While the usual names of the tech industry continue to recruit, many new-age
start-ups and traditional companies have forayed into the space. Technology
professionals continue to be in demand and command competitive pay packages
and hikes if they have a suitable knowledge base and practical skill set. The results of
our assessment report have motivated us to double down on our efforts, and we
hope it will help our learners understand that there is a sustainable career path for
those who work hard, stay consistent, and prioritise practical learning.

“I used to be very unfamiliar with coding
fundamentals back in my college. So, when I
decided to build on my coding skills and CS
fundamentals, Scaler was my guiding light. My
experience with them has taught me
consistency, discipline, and adaptation, which
are crucial characteristics that will always help
one to succeed in the long run. For someone
Krishna Chaitanya
of my background to score offers from tech
giants like Walmart speaks for itself!”
“My jump to IT wouldn’t have been half as
smooth had it not been for excellent lessons from
Kshitij Mishra and Rahul Yadav, or the
outstanding mentorship from Nirav Akbari and
Rishika Agarwal. Consistently practising problems
every single day for 200+ days definitely paid-off
in the end, and I have Scaler to thank for
Bhaskar Shaw supporting me in every way possible. They left no
stone unturned, be it a fantastic curriculum,
personalised mentorship or ample placement
opportunities.”
‘Working at Google is a dream for all techies, and
Scaler helped me realise this dream. Their course
structure is impeccable and has helped me
widen my knowledge horizon beyond the basics.
They have truly established that knowledge is not
limited to the four walls of a classroom, and I am

Co-founders’ Note

The last two years have been challenging worldwide; and while the overall sentiment
might be cautious, we see technology influencing and entering sectors that
traditionally have kept away from it. With Data Science, Machine Learning, and Al
taking the centre stage, we will see a lot of unique opportunities for those well-versed

in the software-tech ecosystem. Our assessment report highlights this very fact.

While the usual names of the tech industry continue to recruit, many new-age
start-ups and traditional companies have forayed into the space. Technology
professionals continue to be in demand and command competitive pay packages
and hikes if they have a suitable knowledge base and practical skill set. The results of
our assessment report have motivated us to double down on our efforts, and we
hope it will help our learners understand that there is a sustainable career path for

those who work hard, stay consistent, and prioritise practical learning.

Dear Sir,
Re: Assessment of Placement Data for placements of Academy and Data Science courses for Scaler

We have assessed the data related to CTC and designations as presented in the appended Placement
Summary regarding the placements of learners of the Scaler Academy and Scaler Data Science
courses, respectively, of Scaler.

In this context, we confirm the following:

1. The assignment was for the assessment and analysis of the placement data of Scaler.

2. For the purpose of the Assessment, we have obtained all the data, information and
explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary from Scaler.
The analysis and assessment have been carried out based on the same.

3. The primary data sourcing methodology from the learners was either 1:1 telephonic calls by
Scaler or from the offer letters (wherever available) verified by B2K Analytics.

4. The appended placement summary has been prepared based on the available data of the
2223 Scaler learners (1978 Scaler Academy and 245 Academy DSML learners).

5. We have, on a random sample basis, verified that the learners in question are indeed
bonafide students of the said courses at Scaler.

6. Considering that sharing sensitive information such as Employment, remuneration, etc. are
completely at the discretion of individual learners, data availability has been a challenge.
This is due to the employment agreements and confidentiality clauses of employers of Scaler
Learners’ which restrict sharing of such information.

because of the skills they possess and also the approach
taken by Scaler towards the training process itself.

At XpressBees we are looking at engineers who are very
strong with Data Structure, Alogrithms, Cloud Computing,

Scaler Engineers have been molded by the training program
to meet our requirements exactly.”

“Scaler Academy's training program has been instrumental

Co-founders’ Note

The last two years have been challenging worldwide; and while the overall sentiment
might be cautious, we see technology influencing and entering sectors that
traditionally have kept away from it. With Data Science, Machine Learning, and Al
taking the centre stage, we will see a lot of unique opportunities for those well-versed

in the software-tech ecosystem. Our assessment report highlights this very fact.

While the usual names of the tech industry continue to recruit, many new-age
start-ups and traditional companies have forayed into the space. Technology
professionals continue to be in demand and command competitive pay packages
and hikes if they have a suitable knowledge base and practical skill set. The results of
our assessment report have motivated us to double down on our efforts, and we
hope it will help our learners understand that there is a sustainable career path for

those who work hard, stay consistent, and prioritise practical learning.

Dear Sir,
Re: Assessment of Placement Data for placements of Academy and Data Science courses for Scaler

We have assessed the data related to CTC and designations as presented in the appended Placement
Summary regarding the placements of learners of the Scaler Academy and Scaler Data Science
courses, respectively, of Scaler.

In this context, we confirm the following:

1. The assignment was for the assessment and analysis of the placement data of Scaler.

2. For the purpose of the Assessment, we have obtained all the data, information and
explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary from Scaler.
The analysis and assessment have been carried out based on the same.

3. The primary data sourcing methodology from the learners was either 1:1 telephonic calls by
Scaler or from the offer letters (wherever available) verified by B2K Analytics.

4. The appended placement summary has been prepared based on the available data of the
2223 Scaler learners (1978 Scaler Academy and 245 Academy DSML learners).

5. We have, on a random sample basis, verified that the learners in question are indeed
bonafide students of the said courses at Scaler.

6. Considering that sharing sensitive information such as Employment, remuneration, etc. are
completely at the discretion of individual learners, data availability has been a challenge.
This is due to the employment agreements and confidentiality clauses of employers of Scaler
Learners’ which restrict sharing of such information.

What is Scaler Academy?
Scaler Academy is an online, transformative upskilling platform for working tech
professionals. Our industry-vetted approach towards teaching & training young
professionals not only helps them upskill but also #CreateImpact in the real world. We
are dedicated to creating an ecosystem that nurtures our learners and helps them
unlock their talent, skills, and opportunities at every stage of their careers. Learners
enrolled with us are taught, guided, and mentored by industry veterans and experts
from leading tech organizations, including Google, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon,
Hotstar, and Twitter.
Founders
Founded by IIIT Hyderabad alums Anshuman Singh and Abhimanyu Saxena.
Pre-Scaler, Anshuman was working with Facebook in the USA office as a Technical
Team Lead, where he helped in building Facebook chats and messages, along with
Messenger. He then moved to London to build Facebook’s first office outside of the
USA, which would work to automate the data ingestion framework. He is a competitive
programmer and a two-time ACM ICPC World Finalist. Abhimanyu led a high-velocity
team that designed NYC-based retail marketplace Fab.com’s entire front end before
joining Scaler as a co-founder. As a seasoned entrepreneur, Abhimanyu co-founded his
first enterprise, Daksh Home Automation System, in his engineering days. He worked
on developing a cost-effective and green AI system to reduce electricity consumption by
at least 15% per household.
What do we do?
Scaler aims to effectively enhance the skills of tech professionals with an
industry-vetted approach. We are on a mission to create 1M+ world-class tech
professionals by providing them with exceptional mentorship and relevant course
material to #CreateImpact.
Our teaching army (instructors + mentors) of veterans from Top Tech Giants guides and
mentors every learner, according to their individual pace. From preparing for interviews
to helping them overcome their career hurdles, the assistance is provided via both 1:1
mentorship and group discussions. Apart from that, the Scaler Community of Learners,

upskilling. We provide them access to a comprehensive curriculum, industry-relevant
skills, Live Classes, Mock Interviews, and 1:1 Mentorship from over 1000 experts from
established companies including Meta, Amazon, Google, Directi and Microsoft.
Combining all, we aim to bridge the gap between the Tech Industry and Tech Education.
Why do we do?
In this dynamic world, where innovation is the catalyst for change, it is high time to
revamp the tech learning system. The more we engaged with tech professionals, the
more we realised the dire need for an industry-relevant curriculum and upright
mentorship that helps aspiring learners upskill and forge ahead in their respective fields.
Within a year of starting our operations, we have successfully upskilled 4000+
graduates by assisting them to land their dream jobs in leading tech companies. Over

“Working at Google is a dream for
all techies, and Scaler helped me
realise this dream. Their course
structure is impeccable and has
helped me widen my knowledge
horizon beyond the basics. They
have truly established that
knowledge is not limited to the
four walls of a classroom, and | am
grateful for all that | have learned!”

Mayank Khandelwal

“The best way to learn something
is by diving straight into the deep
end and broadening your
horizons. For that, | would like to
specifically thank Srikanth Varma
Chekuri. Having an in-depth
understanding of the various
projects we can target—as a
fresher or an experienced
professional - was super exciting
to learn about.”

on my fundamentals but got the
whole grand package instead. And
it was easily the best decision |
could have made for myself! | got a
much-needed skill boost and
developed a focused and
disciplined mindset that helped
me pave my way towards
companies like Microsoft and
Oracle.”

team—great instructors like Mohit
Uniyal and Scaler’s teaching
assistants made my transition into
the DSML field very smooth. While
Data Analytics wasn't my initial area

Career Transition
Assessment
Report
2024
Assessed by

--- Page 2 ---
Co-founders’ Note
The last two years have been challenging worldwide; and while the overall sentiment
might be cautious, we see technology influencing and entering sectors that
traditionally have kept away from it. With Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI
taking the centre stage, we will see a lot of unique opportunities for those well-versed
in the software-tech ecosystem. Our assessment report highlights this very fact.
While the usual names of the tech industry continue to recruit, many new-age
start-ups and traditional companies have forayed into the space. Technology
professionals continue to be in demand and command competitive pay packages
and hikes if they have a suitable knowledge base and practical skill set. The results of
our assessment report have motivated us to double down on our efforts, and we
hope it will help our learners understand that there is a sustainable career path for
those who work hard, stay consistent, and prioritise practical learning.

"Scaler is one of the best platform I have come
across. I did enough research prior to investing in
Scaler. If you use it properly, it is the best platform.
They are doing a fantastic job & the instructors are
superb. They keep teaching us and clearing doubts
beyond midnight. I'm happy to see the dedication
Vivek Prakash
of the entire team."
“It just feels like yesterday that I joined Scaler's Data
Science and Machine Learning Program. I do not
even remember how the past few months just flew
by. The last 1 year at Scaler has literally altered the
course of my life. From being completely
directionless and hopeless, to regaining my
Avijit Swain
confidence, this has been an unbelievable
turnaround for me.”
“To upskill and prepare for a career in data science,
I joined Scaler. The curriculum is amazing and the
assignments help you build your problem-solving
ability step-by-step! In the initial days of my course,
I was balancing my Master's, work and also Scaler
curriculum. It was quite hard, but with time, I

“I was already impressed with the first
Masterclass taken by Mudit Goel. But when I
began the DSML course, it was even better with
my instructor Bipin Kalra who taught me to
code from the scratch and help me fight
against my coding phobia. In fact, I had no
option but to fight the phobia.
Sudhendu Kumar Learning about DSML every day is making me
realise how broad its scope is. And especially
with the emerging trends, this field is only
bound to grow further.”
“I’d like to thank the Scaler team- from great
instructors like Mohit Uniyal to Scaler teaching
assistants who made my transition into the
DSML field so much smoother. While Data
Analytics wasn't my initial area of interest,
attending classes and immersing myself in
Sunshodan Makkar learning allowed me to discover a genuine
interest and passion for it.”
“The best way to learn something is by diving
straight into the deep-end and broadening your
horizons. For that, I would like to specifically
thank Srikanth Varma Chekuri. Having an
in-depth understanding of the various projects
we can target - as a fresher or an experienced
Mayank Khandelwal
professional - was super exciting to learn about.”

Founders

Founded by IIIT Hyderabad alums Anshuman Singh and Abhimanyu Saxena.
Pre-Scaler, Anshuman was working with Facebook in the USA office as a Technical
Team Lead, where he helped in building Facebook chats and messages, along with
Messenger. He then moved to London to build Facebook’s first office outside of the
USA, which would work to automate the data ingestion framework. He is a competitive
programmer and a two-time ACM ICPC World Finalist. Abhimanyu led a high-velocity
team that designed NYC-based retail marketplace Fab.com’s entire front end before
joining Scaler as a co-founder. As a seasoned entrepreneur, Abhimanyu co-founded his
first enterprise, Daksh Home Automation System, in his engineering days. He worked
on developing a cost-effective and green Al system to reduce electricity consumption by
at least 15% per household.

India's business landscape is experiencing a seismic shift. Technological
advancements & integrations, initiatives like 'Make in India' and increased
startup funding have transformed how Indians approach business.
Today technology is no longer an afterthought, it is a critical element for the
survival of a business.
However, traditional B-schools need to prepare graduates to meet the
challenges of the modern business world. There’s a substantial gap between
what conventional business programs teach and the skills needed to thrive in
this tech-powered business landscape. A 2020 India Skill Report shows that
only 46.59% of students have enough professional skills to get hired.

The Need for an
Industry-focused B-school
in Today's India
The world of business is revolutionising faster than before. The present times have
signalled a clear shift powered by tech advancements like AI, ML, Blockchain and
more. Hence, the future of work demands a tech-savvy workforce. A McKinsey
report estimates that 375M* global workers will need to adapt to AI and
automation by 2030. India will face an even steeper challenge based on how
organisations adapt and adopt the change.
Early business education began with foundational subjects like maths and
economics to equip students with core business understanding. Over time, with
the industry’s growing needs, it expanded to functions like marketing, finance,
and operations. Today, however, the focus has shifted towards industry-specific
skills and integrating technology into business strategy.
2024 demands an educational approach that is practical-first, tech elevated
and goes beyond the traditional. Moreover, a survey by GMAC emphasises how
‘soft skills’ like the ability to adapt to technological shifts and strategic thinking will
be valued more over traditional business knowledge.
With 10M new jobs* projected by 2027 in India, we aim to equip future leaders
with the skills to thrive in this digital era. Our PG Program in Mgmt. & Tech focuses
on empowering students through practical skills & equipping them with tech.

Software is eating the world. New-age tech is making our lives easy,
but it also comes with its set of complications. To cope with it, we must
equip future generations with relevant skills.
Capped by an outdated curriculum, 90% of tech graduates today aren’t
equipped with basic skills like problem-solving and communication, let
alone new-age skills like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data
Engineering, etc.
We at Scaler firmly believe that skills matter. Over the past 8 years,
we’ve been working tirelessly to build the top 1% of software engineers.
And we’ve achieved stellar success – 40,000+ learners have paved their
way to top product companies. In 2021, Amazon hired more people from
Scaler than all the IITs combined. With the launch of Scaler School of
Technology, we can do this at the graduate level.

Built for the Industry, by the Industry — our vision with this 4-year
residential programme is to build the Ivy League for CS that propels the
tech industry forward via a diverse community that values collaboration
and thrives on collective achievements. Even NITI AAYOG’s Former CEO
Amitabh Kant echoed our vision.
“Today, where even top-tier
institutes like IITs are running
old syllabi, Scaler does the job
of producing high-quality
Engineers.”

Ex-CEO, NITI Aayog, Govt. of India
Out of 54,000+ applicants, only 191 students made it through the 3.8%
selection rate to our first Batch of 2023 - 2027. So far, they have excelled in
academic endeavours – hackathons and ICPC regionals; and got relevant
industry exposure — sessions by industry veterans. All this is a testament to
a solid learning ecosystem.
From my experience of building Facebook Messenger, setting up
Facebook’s office in London, and interviewing hundreds of candidates,
I can confidently vouch that this programme is the first-of-its-kind in the
country to be implemented at the graduate level.

Software is eating the world. New-age tech is making our lives easy,
but it also comes with its set of complications. To cope with it, we must
equip future generations with relevant skills.

Capped by an outdated curriculum, 90% of tech graduates today aren't
equipped with basic skills like problem-solving and communication, let
alone new-age skills like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data

Engineering, etc.

We at Scaler firmly believe that skills matter. Over the past 8 years,
we've been working tirelessly to build the top 1% of software engineers.
And we've achieved stellar success —- 40,000+ Learners have paved their
way to top product companies. In 2021, Amazon hired more people from
Scaler than all the IITs combined. With the Launch of Scaler School of
Technology, we can do this at the graduate level.

The next 10 years will see 9 crore new jobs for software engineers* alone.
Every year 10 lakh students apply for CS at top IITs, but only 500 seats are
available. Implying only 0.05% of applicants get access to these seats.
Highly skilled software engineers are in very high demand and will continue
