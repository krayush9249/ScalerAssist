There’s a substantial gap between\\nwhat conventional business programs teach and the skills needed to thrive in\\nthis tech-powered business landscape.

After months of research and gauging the\\ncurrent industry needs, we\\'ve designed a program that delivers just that.\\n\\nThrough Scaler School of Business, we are launching a one-of-a-kind PG Program\\nin Management & Technology, 18 months long, full-time, and on campus. The PG\\nProgram in Mgmt and Tech places a premium on practical and experiential\\nlearning, through company-sourced projects, immersive case studies, and\\ndirect engagement with industry leaders. Our students will gain invaluable\\nexperience that transcends the confines of the classroom, leaving no stone unturned\\nand no business fundamentals unlearned.

The present times have\\nsignalled a clear shift powered by tech advancements like Al, ML, Blockchain and\\nmore. Hence, the future of work demands a tech-savvy workforce. A McKinsey\\nreport estimates that 375M* global workers will need to adapt to Al and\\nautomation by 2030. India will face an even steeper challenge based on how\\n\\norganisations adapt and adopt the change.\\n\\nEarly business education began with foundational subjects like maths and\\neconomics to equip students with core business understanding. Over time, with\\nthe industry\\'s growing needs, it expanded to functions like marketing, finance,\\nand operations. Today, however, the focus has shifted towards industry-specific\\n\\nskills and integrating technology into business strategy.\\n\\n2024 demands an educational approach that is practical-first, tech elevated\\nand goes beyond the traditional. Moreover, a survey by GMAC emphasises how\\n‘soft skills’ like the ability to adapt to technological shifts and strategic thinking will\\n\\nbe valued more over traditional business knowledge.\\n\\nWith 10M new jobs* projected by 2027 in India, we aim to equip future leaders\\nwith the skills to thrive in this digital era.

With Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI\\ntaking the centre stage, we will see a lot of unique opportunities for those well-versed\\nin the software-tech ecosystem. Our assessment report highlights this very fact.\\nWhile the usual names of the tech industry continue to recruit, many new-age\\nstart-ups and traditional companies have forayed into the space. Technology\\nprofessionals continue to be in demand and command competitive pay packages\\nand hikes if they have a suitable knowledge base and practical skill set. The results of\\nour assessment report have motivated us to double down on our efforts, and we\\nhope it will help our learners understand that there is a sustainable career path for\\nthose who work hard, stay consistent, and prioritise practical learning.\\nAbhimanyu\\nAnshuman\\nSaxena\\nSingh\\nAssessed by\\n\\n--- Page 3 ---\\nAssessed by\\n\\n--- Page 4 ---\\nPlease note:\\nThe data set includes learners who have completed their mandatory modules\\nand have completed a period of 6 months post that, as of Jan 1, 2024.\\nPast results do not guarantee future placements.\\nCareer transition outcomes are a result of building skills.

With Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI\\ntaking the centre stage, we will see a lot of unique opportunities for those well-versed\\nin the software-tech ecosystem. Our assessment report highlights this very fact.\\nWhile the usual names of the tech industry continue to recruit, many new-age\\nstart-ups and traditional companies have forayed into the space. Technology\\nprofessionals continue to be in demand and command competitive pay packages\\nand hikes if they have a suitable knowledge base and practical skill set. The results of\\nour assessment report have motivated us to double down on our efforts, and we\\nhope it will help our learners understand that there is a sustainable career path for\\nthose who work hard, stay consistent, and prioritise practical learning.\\nAbhimanyu\\nAnshuman\\nSaxena\\nSingh\\nAssessed by\\n\\n--- Page 3 ---\\nAssessed by\\n\\n--- Page 4 ---\\nPlease note:\\nThe data set includes learners who have completed their mandatory modules\\nand have completed a period of 6 months post that, as of Jan 1, 2024.\\nPast results do not guarantee future placements.\\nCareer transition outcomes are a result of building skills.
